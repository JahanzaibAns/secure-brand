                                    <h5>Trademark</h5>
                                    <p>A trademark generally protects a word, phrase, symbol and/or design that
                                        distinguishes the source of the goods -- what we think of as brand name and
                                        brand recognition. A trademark, if properly maintained, can last forever. </p>

                                    <h5>Patent</h5>
                                    <p>A patent generally protects an invention, including the functionality or design,
                                        or in other words, “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or
                                        composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” 35 U.S.C. §
                                        101. A patent typically gives the owner the exclusive right to manufacture
                                        products or employ processes covered by the patent for 20 years from the
                                        earliest priority date. </p>

                                    <h5>Copyright</h5>
                                    <p>Copyrights generally protect artistic works such as books, photographs, arts,
                                        movies and music. </p>

                                    <h5>How long will the federal trademark registration last? </h5>
                                    <p>It can last up to 10 years. The registration can easily be renewed so long as you
                                        have made sure to maintain an uninterrupted use of your trademark in interstate
                                        commerce. </p>

                                    <p><strong>Likelihood of confusion:</strong> When the USPTO determines that two
                                        trademarks would cause confusion with one another, they issue a “likelihood of
                                        confusion” refusal. Applicants may respond by making appropriate legal arguments
                                        contending that the two trademarks are not so similar as to be confusing.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Descriptiveness:</strong> If a trademark describes the goods or services
                                        that it represents, it is descriptive. The USPTO will refuse to register a
                                        descriptive trademark on the Principal Trademark Register but may register the
                                        mark on the Supplemental Trademark Register.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Merely ornamental:</strong> If you use the trademark as a decoration and
                                        not as a brand, the USPTO deems such use as “merely ornamental.” The USPTO
                                        refuses to register merely ornamental trademarks.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Specimen Refusal:</strong> If a trademark specimen does not show proper
                                        trademark usage, the application gets refused. To solve this problem, submit a
                                        trademark specimen that shows adequate usage of the trademark.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Surname Refusal:</strong> The USPTO might take issue if the proposed
                                        trademark is mainly a last name. This is called a “surname refusal.”</p>
                                    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If a trademark contains a common word, such as
                                        “incorporated” or “studios,” the USPTO will want the applicant to disclaim that
                                        word. Disclaiming the word means that the applicant does not assert rights to
                                        that particular word. However, this decision must be considered carefully.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Class Refusal:</strong> If you file your trademark application in the
                                        wrong trademark class (or your application requires additional trademark
                                        classes), you will need to fi that.</p>

                                        Actions, the cost to draft and submit an office action response will only be a

                                    <p><strong>Non-final Office Action:</strong> If an issue is being raised for the

                                        Office action explains the problems with the application and gives the applicant
                                        an opportunity to address or correct them.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Final Office Action:</strong> If the applicant has failed to overcome the
                                        issues raised in a previous Office Action, the USPTO will issue a final Office

                                        Most objections require the applicant to make fairly simple amendments to the
                                        application and typically involves things like fixing incorrect information
                                        about the applicant (perhaps the company is an LLC even though the application
                                        is listed as a corporation), and/or “disclaiming” the rights to one of the words
